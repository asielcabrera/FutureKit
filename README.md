# FutureKit

**Future** represents a result of a task which may be available now, or in the future, or never. **Future** provides a streamlined **`Future<Value, Error>`** type engineered with ergonomics and performance in mind.

Futures enable composition of tasks using familiar functions like `map`, `flatMap`, `zip`, `reduce` and others which are all easy to learn and use.
